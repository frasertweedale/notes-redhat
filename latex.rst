``ucs``
-------

``utf8x`` package enables ``ucs`` which provides mappings of many
unicode characters to latex.  Some mappings are not loaded by
default; you may see an error like::

  ! Package ucs Error: Unknown Unicode character 8345 = U+2099,
  (ucs)                possibly declared in uni-32.def.
  (ucs)                Type H to see if it is available with options.

In this particular case the ``autogenerated`` option loads the
needed definition::

 \usepackage[autogenerated]{ucs}

``autogenerated`` provides definitions of characters that can be
"constructed" from existing glyphs, however you need to define some
macros.  You might get an error like::

  ! Undefined control sequence.
  \u-autogenerated-8345 #1->\unicodesub 
                                        {\unichar {110}}
                                        l.345 \end{frame}

Here the undefined macro is ``\unicodesub``.  We can define it as
``\textsubscript`` to achieve the desired effect::

  \newcommand{\unicodesub}{\textsubscript}

See the `ucs documentation`_ for more info.
