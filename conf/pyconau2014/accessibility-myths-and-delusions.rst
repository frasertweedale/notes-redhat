Accessibility - Myths and Delusions; Katie Cunningham
=====================================================


What is accessibility?

  All the data and all the functionality for all the people.


Myths and Delusions
===================

Myth: it's just about blind people, right?
------------------------------------------

# The blind (anyone who uses a screen reader to access and
  application)
# The visually disabled, including colour-blind.
# Hearing disabled, including partial-hearing loss.
# Physically disabled.  Shaky and jerky movement.
  - some can only use keyboard
  - some can only use mouse
  - some can only do things slowly
  - pain issues
# Cognitively disabled, including information processing
  disabilities including dyslexia, ADHD.


Delusion: I don't have any disabled user
----------------------------------------

- 4M disabled people in Australia.  One in five.
- 3.4M have a physical disability.  Some may impact computer use.
- One in six have some form of hearing loss
- 600k have some form of develo9pmental disability
- 10% has dyslexia
- One percent on autism spectrum
- Five to ten percent have ADD or ADHD
- One in ten men are color blind
- Not every disability is visible (90% of them are invisible).


Myth: It's just the US right?
-----------------------------

- most countries have a mandate about accessibility
- WCAG required for govt websites.
- In US, several large corporations have been sued.


Delusion: I can't afford it!
----------------------------

- It's not that expensive.


Myth: There's a checklist, right?
---------------------------------

- There *are* checklists out there.
- There not *for you*, unless you are an accessibility expert.
- Accessibility is usability for a group of users who have
  additional needs.


Delusion: Technology has solved this issue.
-------------------------------------------

- Technology has helped, but it can't do it all.
- Developers move faster than then accessibility industry can.
- We need to be better as developer about reaching back, so
  accessibility people don't have as far to run.


Myth: Flash is totally accessible
---------------------------------

- Nope.  It just isn't.
- I've seen a lot of Flash apps, and not a single one has passed the
  sniff test.


Delusion: disabled people are experts at being disabled
-------------------------------------------------------

- Not everyone is born disabled.
- Not everyone is permanently disabled.
- If you become disabled, it can take months or years to adapt.


Myth: You can't make iOS/Android apps accessible
------------------------------------------------

- It's actually really easy.
- Smartphones were developed after accessibility became mandatory
  for govt in many countries.


Myth: I can't test for accessibility.  JAWS is expensive.
---------------------------------------------------------

- Every major OS comes with a perfectly servicable screen reader.
- JAWS is just for Windows anyway.
- On Windows: nvda by nvaccess.


Delusion: We'll fix it later
----------------------------

- Way cheaper to think about it from the beginning


Myth: it only benefits disable people
-------------------------------------

- A website that has been made accessible is better for *everyone*.
- Forcing yourself to just think about, e.g. colours, for
  accessibility, causes you to think about colour choices in
  general.
- UX *necessary* for disabled people can lead to good UX for *all
  people*.


Delusion: I'll never need it
----------------------------

- Age happens.
- You can still break an arm or get sick.
- If you won't do it for the people who are disabled today, do it
  for the person *you* might be in 10 or 20 years.
- Now is the time for accessibility to become a habit.
- Now is the time to build cultures where we don't just think about
  the *average* user, but about *all* users.
