What art is
-----------

  "Art is not what is not art" - Ad Reinhart in 'Art as Art', 1962

Definition by Donald Brook, Experimental Art Foundation:

- art changes the way you see the world
- art is the root of language
- art is the result of experimental process
  # the artist must *intend* it to be art
  # it must be *public*
  # people must *recognise* it as art

*Conceptual artists are mystics rather than rationalists.  They lap
to conclusions that logic cannot reach.* - Sentences on
Conceptual Art, Sol Lewitt.

The experimental process:

# Vision
# Create
# Show
# Reflect
# GOTO 1

The creative stuff happens in *vision*.  The other parts of the
process are rigorous.

*Once the idea of the piece is established in the artist's mind and
tinal form is decided, the process is carried out blindly.  There
are many side effects the artists cannot imagine.  These may be used
as ideas for new works.* - Sentences on Cenceptual Art, Sol Lewitt.

- Follow ideas through to conclusion.
- Keep track of side effects.

*Rational judgement repeat rational judgements.  Irrational
judgements lead to new experience.*

- look for new things
- new things come out of the side effects
- sometimes it's worth trying something that looks like it won't
  work.

*THe concept and the idea are different.  THe former implies a
general direction while the latter is the component.  ideas
implement the concept.*

- the concept of this presentation is to enhance your creativity
- each slide takes an idea, and hopefully they implement the
  concept.

*Ideas do not necessarily proceed in logical order.  they may set
one off in unexpected directions, but an idea must necessarily be
completed in the mind before the next one is formed.*

*Perception of ideas leads to new ideas*

- try stuff, read stuff, research stuff, talk to  people=, show
  stuf.

*Ideas can be works of art; they are in a chain on development that
may eventually find some form.  all ideas need not be moade
physical*.

*The artists cannot imagine his art and cannot perceive it until it
is complete*.

*THe words of one artist to another may induce an idea chain, if
they share the same concept*.

*The artists may not necessarily understand his own art.  His
perception is neither better nor worse than that of others.  An
artist may perceive the art of others better than his own.*

- other people often understand an artist's work better than the
  artists

*The concept of a work of art may involve the matter of the piece or
the process in which it is made.*

- a painting may be about the act of painting, i.e. you could have
  chosen any medium.

*it is difficult to bungle a good idea*
