Patents, Copyrights & Trademark... Oh, why?! - Andrea Casillas
==============================================================

- "IP" covers three areas of law
- Trademark: for logos, names and symbols.
- Copyright: written word, art and music
- Patent: inventions
- none of these were created with software in mind.


Trademark
---------

- Is this from who I think it's from; will it be good?
- Trademark is limited in scope. i.e. red triangle for beer and red
  triangle for petrol can coexist.  Trademarks state their scope.
- Python has a trademark.
- Not allowed:
  - altering logo
  - changing name but using logo
  - if it feels shady, it's probably illegal.
- usually good:
  - use mark to refer to holder or talk about them, or using
    something of theirs
  - use trademark to impersonate holder, using own version of mark
    in similar context, use mark to imply endorsement you don't
    have.
- other things that can be trademarked: colour, sound, etc.


Copyright
---------

- originally just for books
- initially a two-year limitation, then things got longer and longer
  - now lifetime + 70y.
- copyrightable: literary works, art, music
  - from 1971: software
- all software licenses rest on copyright law.

Picking a license:

- check upstream/dependencies
- check with boss
- copyleft and derivative works vs permissive licenses; creating new
  licenses not recommended (unless you're an expert)


Patents
-------

- pertain to functionality.
- the point is to promote innovation
- limited monopoly on invention; typically 20y.
- share what you did with the public; after expiration public can
  use invention.
- what is *not* patentable:
  - abstract tehories ideas and concepts, natural laws or processes,
    algorithms (on their own), mathematical equations
  - inventions that are already known or used ~ novelty
  - obvious fixes (non-obviousness requirement)
  - out of scope (of reality), e.g. time machine.
  - illegal activities
- software patents: "this is how I fix the problem... on a computer"
- most lawyers will *deter* you from looking at a patent.  better to
  be wilfully ignorant (3X damages if shown that you knew about a
  patent)

- huge recent spike in suits involving Non-Practicing Entities
  (NPEs) aka Trolls.

What can you do?

- join a non-aggression community for Free Software
- includes access to a defensive patent pool, e.g. Open Invention
  Network.
- choose a license that has a patent clause
- defensively publish, e.g. Linux Defenders.  Curate prior art.


Reacp
-----

- I am not *your* lawyer.
- Trademark: don't pretend to be someone else
- Copyright: choose a license that matches the goals for you code
- Patents: the best offense is a good defense.
